/*

1.The fn main() function is the entry point of the program.
2.Inside the main() function, a variable n is declared and assigned the value 10.
3.The [if] statement checks if n is greater than 10. If the condition is true, it prints "Greater than 10".
4.The [else if] statement checks if n is equal to 10. If the condition is true, it prints "Equal to 10".
5.If neither the if nor the else if condition is met, the [else] block is executed, and it prints "Smaller than 10".
